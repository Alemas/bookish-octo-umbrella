Read numbers from file and makes operations with them (+/*)


You gotta have node.js installed for this to work.

First run:

```
npm install
```

so you get the necessary packages (only `fs` is required).
Then execute the program using:

```
node bin/index.js
```

You can change the numbers by editing the `bin/number` file (use one number per line).
